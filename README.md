###Project
A small script to arrange the images in the present folders and subfolders as
per their time of capture. This would help easing their uploading to google
plus photos, making a clean ordered library along the way.

Due to some blunder my images have been shuffled during import and I'd like them
to be in order.

###Dependencies
1. Python 2.7
2. Python Imaging Library
